        <dt>How do I sign up for an account?</dt>
        <dd>

            Go <a href="https://materialscommons.org">Materials Commons</a> to register for an account. Materials
            Commons is free to use.
        </dd>

        <dt>Can I install my own version of MaterialsCommons?</dt>
        <dd>
            The process for installing your own version of MaterialsCommons
            is not currently documented. MaterialsCommons has a lot of
            dependencies. Our roadmap includes releasing a containerized
            version of the MaterialsCommons. This will allow you to easily
            get your own version of the site up and running using
            <a href="https://www.docker.com" target="_blank">Docker</a>.

        <dt>How do I know my data is safe?</dt>
        <dd>
            The MaterialsCommons stores all data on University of Michigan cloud storage. This is a highly performant
            clustered storage solution managed in a data center.
        </dd>

        <dt>What happens to my data if MaterialsCommons goes away?</dt>
        <dd>
            While we are working hard to make sure that MaterialsCommons has
            a bright and sustainable future, in the event that MaterialsCommons
            does go away all your data will continue to be available. The University of Michigan
            has committed to making sure your data will continue to be available.
