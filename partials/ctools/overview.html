        The PRISMS Center software development is based on an integrated suite of multiscale/multiphysics
        computational codes developed by the various research groups affiliated with the center and are
        facilitated by the research staff and faculty in a highly collaborative environment. The codes are
        hosted at <a href="https://github.com/prisms-center" target="_blank">GitHub</a>  and are subject to our evolving best practices
        and software quality assurance (SQA). Code reviews are regularly conducted and a broadly two stage
        annual release plan involving (I) internal beta release to PRISMS members and collaborators, and (II)
        open-source public release under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) is followed.

        The PRISMS computational tools are designed to provide a general numerical framework for solutions to
        the gamut of multiscale/multiphysics problems encountered in the nano-micro-mesa-macro analysis of
        structural materials. However, given the vast generality and complexity of analytical/numerical/experimental
        challenges possible across these scales, the Center primarily focuses on three scientific challenges: (I)
        Predicting the role of alloy composition and processing on microstructure evolution
        (<a ui-sref="science.precipitate">Precipitate evolution use case</a> and
        <a ui-sref="science.recrystallization">Recrystallization use case</a>), (II) Prediction of tensile
        properties from first principles (<a ui-sref="science.tensile">Tensile properties use case</a>),
        (III) Prediction of fatigue
        behavior (<a ui-sref="science.fatigue">Fatigue behavior use case</a>). These challenges are addressed by a combination of
        <a ui-sref="ctools.software">advanced numerical frameworks</a>, <a ui-sref="ctools.tools">experimental techniques</a> and
        relevant phenomenological models.
