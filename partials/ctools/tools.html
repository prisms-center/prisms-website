    <h4>SEM-DIC</h4>

    <p class="tab-content-details">
        The Daly group has developed (under DOE-BES Award No. DE-SC0003996 and NSF Grant No. 092753) a means for
        full-field, high resolution mapping of deformations at the microstructural length scale using a combination of
        scanning electron microscopy and digital image correlation (termed here as SEM-DIC). The Daly group created
        chemically functionalized nanoparticle self-assembly methods for unprecedented spatial resolution, and developed

        a framework originally proposed by Sutton et al. (Sutton et al., Experimental Mechanics, 2007, 2-part paper
        series) to correct for the complex spatial and temporal distortions inherent in SEM imaging. These techniques,
        combined with corrections for stress relaxation and hardware/software developments for various thermo-mechanical
        testing parameters, enable the acquisition of highly accurate and statistically relevant sub-grain measurements
        of deformation. Distortion-corrected SEM-DIC provides the accuracy, spatial resolution, and large amounts of
        data needed to perform quantitative characterization linking microstructure to deformation.

    <h4>High Resolution Characterization</h4>
    <p class="tab-content-details">
        Atomic scale alloy microstructures are investigated using atom probe tomography
        (APT) and high angle annular dark field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy
        (STEM). Full descriptions of the internal atomic structure, chemistry, interface structure,
        number density, size distributions and 3D morphologies of precipitates may be obtained from
        the complementarity of the two imaging and analysis techniques. To this end, robust and
        efficient quantification methodologies of the data are being developed.

    <h4>Ultrasonic Fatigue SEM (UF-SEM) System</h4>

    <p class="tab-content-details">
        The Jones, Allison and Daly groups have developed a unique capability for rapidly characterizing fatigue
        characteristics of materials at ultrasonic frequencies. Within the PRISMS Center we are extending this
        capability further by inserting our ultrasonic fatigue apparatus into a scanning electron microscope. This
        enables us to characterize crack interactions with local microstructural features in real-time at high
        magnification. The system currently combines ultrasonic fatigue instrumentation with a Tescan Mira3 scanning
        electron microscope, shown below. The load line of the ultrasonic fatigue system is comprised of an ultrasonic
        converter that generates a sinusoidal displacement using a piezoelectric material stack, a Ti-6Al-4V
        amplification horn that magnifies the signal from the ultrasonic converter, a Ti-6Al-4V lambda rod used for
        adjusting the length of the load line, and the fatigue specimen to be tested. The load line is mounted in a
        custom built SEM chamber door, and is controlled by electronic instrumentation that maintains the ultrasonic
        resonant frequency of the load line to within ±1 Hz by monitoring the specimen input displacement using a
        piezoelectric transducer in a closed loop control system. Rotation of the load line along the longitudinal axis
        allows for in situ electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) scanning for crystallographic characterization of
        areas of interest.
