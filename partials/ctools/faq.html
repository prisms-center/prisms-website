        Computational Codes FAQ
    </h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Are the computational codes available to the general public?</dt>
        <dd>
            YES - They are available free via <a href="https://github.com/prisms-center">GitHub</a> under
            the appropriate license. New features are frequently added - typically with a major annual release.
        </dd>

        <dt>Do I need to use all the codes together, or can I just use the ones I'm interested in?</dt>
        <dd>
            Our computational codes can be used standalone, or together. We
            have an integration toolkit that makes it easy to hand data off
            across the different codes, but you are not required to use it.
        </dd>

        <dt>Can I send you pull requests?</dt>
        <dd>
            YES, The codes are available for open-source development - and this is encouraged. You can fork
            our codes, make a change and send us a pull request. We are looking forward to working with the
            community to continue developing and enhancing these codes.
