        PRISMS Integrated Software Framework
    </h2>

    <p class="tab-content-details">
        The PRISMS integrated computational codes for multiscale materials modeling allow for
        fast development of large-scale numerical frameworks for various mathematical models
        of material behavior (Continuum Plasticity, Crystal Plasticity, Phase Field, Statistical
        Mechanics, DFT, etc). Our tools provide scalable high performance computing (HPC)
        capabilities for solving large-scale multiphysics problems and model integration across
        different length scales.

    <p class="tab-content-details">
        Even better, all our tools are released as open source under the GNU
        Lesser General Public License (LGPL) license. You can to take these leading
        edge tools, peak under the hood to see how we do things, and integrate them into
        your research.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="tab-content-details">
        At the PRISMS-Center we strongly believe in building an active and collaborative
        research community for a sustainable development and use of our suite of material
        modeling tools. If you are interested in collaborating and participating in codes
        development head on over to our contact page and drop us a line. Building a
        community and solving hard modeling problems is important to us.

        Each of these codes can be used stand alone or
        in an integrated environment. To support the integration, we also provide an
        integration framework you can use to customize and integrate these tools into your
        existing computational ecosystem.

    <h4>DFT-FE: Real Space Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory Code</h4>
    <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~vikramg/index.html" target="_blank">V. Gavini</a>,

    <p class="tab-content-details">
        Electronic structure calculations have played a significant role in the investigation of
        materials properties over the past few decades. In particular, the Kohn-Sham approach to
        density functional theory (DFT) has made quantum-mechanically informed calculations on
        ground-state materials properties computationally tractable, and has provided many
        important insights into a wide range of materials properties.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-content-details">
        As part of the PRISMS software suite, we are developing a finite element (FEM) based
        real-space numerical framework for modeling Kohn-Sham DFT. Our primary focus is on
        accurate electronic structure study of the energetics of defects in crystalline materials
        using computational domains (with non-periodic/semi-periodic/periodic geometries) containing
        tens of thousands of atoms. PRISMS-DFT provides us a first principles framework for determining relevant
        material properties.

        CASM, a Clusters Approach to Statistical Mechanics, is the PRISMS
        statistical mechanics software.  The current release provides functionality for symmetry
        <a name="pf"></a>
        identification, specification of composition axes, enumeration of
        symmetrically unique supercells and configurations, automatic VASP job
        submission and results collection, use of automatically determined or
        custom reference states for formation energy calculation, and convex
        hull identification. Our next major release will include improved cluster 
        expansion fitting tools and semi-grand canonical ensemble Monte Carlo calculations.

        Phase field models have been central to computational modeling of complex morphological
        evolution in multiphase systems. Here at the PRISMS Center, we are developing a massively
        scalable phase field modeling framework based on the
        <a href="https://www.dealii.org" target="_blank">deal.ii open-source finite element library</a>, which
        provides extensive support for various finite element constructs, peta-scale
        grid generation with adaptivity (p4est adaptive octree meshes), scalable data structures and
        solvers. The PRISMS-PF framework provides a flexible platform for solving a wide range of
        partial differential equations, including, but not limited to, those typically found in
        phase field models. At the PRISMS Center, our initial focus is on phase field modeling
        precipitate evolution in binary and ternary alloys, as well as grain growth and recrystallization.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-content-details">
        Current applications modules include matrix-free implementations of the Allen-Cahn equation,
        Cahn-Hilliard equation, the diffusion equation, and linear elasticity, as well as coupled systems
        with combinations of these equations. The parallel performance and scaling has been demonstrated
        on terascale problems with billions of degrees of freedom running on thousands of processors.
        Benchmarking versus an MPI-parallelized finite difference code has demonstrated over a 4x
        improvement in simulation speed over standard finite difference approaches.

        The PRISMS-Plasticity code is a parallel numerical framework for modeling continuum
        scale elasto-plastic material behavior important to the multiscale materials modeling
        effort of PRISMS. PRISMS-Plasticity encompasses two sub-codes focused on modeling
        elasto-plastic deformation at the macro-scale (Continuum Plasticity) and meso-scale
        (Crystal-Plasticity). The two sub-codes are integrated under a common code base for
        Elliptic Boundary Value problems and is build on top of the
        <a href="https://www.dealii.org" target="_blank">deal.ii</a> open-source finite
        element library.

        Currently available models of crystal plasticity include FCC and BCC, and work is under
        progress for supporting HCP crystals. Under continuum plasticity, we currently support
        J2-flow theory with isotropic hardening, and include the following isotropic non-linear
        hyper-elastic models: Quad-Log, Neo-Hookean, St. Venant Kirchoff.

    <h4>Integration Tools: IntegrationTools and IntegrationToolsWriter</h4>

    <p class="tab-content-details">
        Integration of PRISMS Codes and external codes is an important aspect of the PRISMS
        Integrated Framework. To accomplish this the IntegrationTools package was developed
        and includes the IntegrationTools header file library that defines and implements
        an API for easily passing arbitrary functions and fields, referred to as
        ‘PFunctions’ and ‘PFields’, between different software programs. A separate software
        package, IntegrationToolsWriter was also developed and includes programs that
        generate and compile the C++ code for PFunctions from symbolic mathematical
        expressions. We are using this within PRISMS to facilitate passing parameters
        between codes that operate at different scales in our integrated multi-scale model.

    <h3>Research Codes:</h3>
    <p class="tab-content-details">
        The following codes are being developed to support our in-house research activities
        and are currently being evaluated for suitability to our material modeling efforts.
        They currently do not have a public release schedule.

    <h4>PRISMS-MechanoChemo: Mechano-Chemical Phase Transformations Modeling Code (Research Code)</h4>

    <p class="tab-content-details">
        We are developing a modeling approach for phase transformations that are driven by
        free energies that are non-convex in the strain-composition space by using a coupled
        formulation of finite strain mechanics and diffuse interface theories
        (Cahn-Hilliard and Allen-Cahn). This work is expected to support the PRISMS material
        modeling efforts on two fronts: (I) Provide an alternative model for studying
        precipitate evolution, and (II) Provide a framework for capturing the complex
        kinematics of twin microstructure formation.

    <h4>PRISMS-PFC: Phase Field Crystal Modeling Code</h4>
    <a href="http://www.mse.engin.umich.edu/people/faculty/thornton" target="_blank">K. Thornton</a>
    <p class="tab-content-details">
        The Phase Field Crystal (PFC) model is a simulation approach that can model crystalline
        materials with atomistic resolution but at a diffusive timescale. We are currently
        working on developing an in-house research code.
